Hi there!

I'm Bas, and I make things: music, ideas, design, code, and more. I was trained as an interdisciplinary mathematician, went on to do a masters in logic and PhD in computational musicology at the University of Amsterdam. All the while, I worked as a freelance graphic designer and webdeveloper at Studio Metrum. During my PhD I decided to take up a studies in classical voice, and I am now working as professional classical singer.

Do you want to make something together? Let me know! :-)

Research projects 
-----------------

- 2022 â€” Algo PÃ¤rt: algorithmic recompositions of the music of Arvo PÃ¤rt (to be made public soon)
- 2022 â€” Neural chant: composing plainchant with an LSTM (to be made public soon)
- 2022 â€” [Rhythm triangles](https://github.com/bacor/rhythm-triangles): visualize rhythm in music and animal sounds using rhythm triangles.
- 2022 â€” [Melody squares](https://github.com/bacor/melody-squares): a project visualizing which melodic motifs can be found in a collection of melodies.
- 2022 â€” [Shapes of music](https://github.com/bacor/shapes-of-music): how can one best describe the shapes of melodic phrases in musics from across the globe? This paper adresses precisely that: contour typology.
- 2021 â€” [Catafolk](https://bacor.github.io/catafolk/): A catalogue of folk music corpora for computational ethnomusicology, presented at SysMus21.
- 2021 â€” [Social bonding or credible signaling?](https://bacor.github.io/bbs-commentaries/): two target articles in BBS discussed the origins of musicality. We asked and visualized where the commentators would position themselves in this debate.
- 2021 â€” [Cosine contours](https://github.com/bacor/cosine-contours/) an ISMIR 2021 paper on a novel representation for melodic contours based on cosines.
- 2020 â€” [Mode classification and natural units in plainchant](https://github.com/bacor/ISMIR2020): an ISMIR 2020 paper that classifies mode in plainchant and by doing so finds evidence for a 'natural' units of chant. This paper won the best multi/interdisciplinary research award!
- 2020 â€” [GregoBaseCorpus](https://github.com/bacor/GregoBaseCorpus) and [CantusCorpus](https://github.com/bacor/CantusCorpus) are two large corpora of plainchant which we presented at [DLfM 2020](https://github.com/bacor/DLfM2020)
- 2017 â€”Â [Painter](https://github.com/bacor/painter): an animated drawing environment intended for online iterated learning experiments.
- 2017 â€”Â [Bayesian Language Games](https://github.com/bacor/thesis): a project that unifies iterated learning with naming games in a new Bayesian language game (MSc thesis)
- 2016 â€”Â UvA speech to song dataset, presented at ICMPC 2016 (dataset to be made public soon) 
- 2015 â€” [Analogy Colouring](https://github.com/bacor/AnalogyColouring): a novel variant of the pictorial analogy task, that asks subjects to colour drawings in the same way (student project).
